# Classification-using-OpenAI-embedding
I have followed the following point while doing this experiment.

1. Choose an OpenAI Model for embedding.
  There are seveal choices among the OpenAI models like GPT, GPT-2, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, ADA etc.
  Here I have chosen ADA model for embedding purposes.

2. Initialize the OpenAI Model
  Use the OpenAI API to initialize the chosen model. Here I am using the Azure Open AI services to intitialize the service.
  Please refer the code for more details.

3. Tokenize and Embed the Text Data
  Use the initialized model to generate embeddings for each tokenized text. Concatenate or average the embeddings for each text to obtain a single vector representation for the entire text.

4. Train a Classifier
  Split your dataset into training and testing sets. Choose a classifier suitable for your task, such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Neural Networks. I have chosen Random forest classifer. It was supposed give a     good accuracy.Train the classifier using the embedded representations of your training data.

5. Evaluate the Classifier
  Test the classifier using the embedded representations of your testing data. Evaluate the performance of the classifier using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. Make Predictions
  Once your classifier is trained and evaluated, you can use it to make predictions on new, unseen text data. Embed the new text data using the same process described above. Feed the embedded representations into your trained classifier to classify the new data based on similarity.
